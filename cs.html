      <p>Computer science engineering includes the study of design, computational processes and programming languages. Students get to learn technical know-how about how to develop a variety of hardwares and softwares and gain knowledge about communications systems and other similar devices. Usually students and potential candidates tend to confuse computer science engineering and computer science as one subject. There is a large difference between both subjects. Computer science is a study focused on troubleshooting issues on a software level. This study deals with programming languages and operating systems and learning the technical aspects related to software and its advancements. On the other hand, computer engineering is a study focused on hardware and software interface development as well as its related problems.
